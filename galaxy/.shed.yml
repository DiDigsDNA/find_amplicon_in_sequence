description: Searches sequences in a nucleotide fasta file for exact matches to PCR oligonucleotides (using information contained in an oligonucleotide definition file), and outputs sequences lacking an exact match to fasta format for further analysis.

long_description: This script is the first in a set of custom scripts to facilitate in-silico screening of sequences for exact PCR primers and probe hybridization sites to screen for strains of target organism that may not be detected by lab-developed PCR assays. 
This script searches a nucleotide fasta file for an exact match to the PCR amplicon, using information from an assay-specific oligonucleotide (csv) definition file. The amplicon is created from primers and probe in the correct order, with intervening regions of 0-100 N's.
Each query fasta sequence is read as a Biopython SeqRecord and searched for an exact match to the amplicon (or its reverse complement) - allowing degenerate bases - and sequences lacking an exact match are output
to fasta for downstream analysis. A summary containing record IDs of non-matching sequences is printed to a text file.
